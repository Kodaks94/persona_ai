## üìÑ Selected Projects

### 1. **MemoFormer**
A transformer with dynamic GRU-style memory tokens. Designed for long-range forecasting tasks in hydrology (spring flow, temperature, GWL) and cancer microenvironment analysis. Includes autoregressive rollout and scheduled sampling.
### 2. **RNA BPTT Reinforcement Learning Simulator**
A differentiable reinforcement learning simulator for designing RNA sequences. Targets folding accuracy, motif placement, and structural entropy using ViennaRNA as oracle. Optimized using gradient-informed surrogate models.

### 3. **Neurofolding: RNA Design via Transformer + RL**
Created a novel hybrid architecture combining transformer attention, LSTM/GRU memory, and autoregressive sampling. Introduced a differentiable folding reward pipeline for biologically meaningful RNA synthesis. Named the method *Neurofolding*.

### 4. **Maze RL Agent with Memory**
Developed and published a tabular Q-learning agent augmented with explicit memory vectors for navigation in mazes with randomized exits. Outperformed RNN-based agents with lower computational cost.

Large-scale visual classifier for Pok√©mon TCG cards using EfficientNetB0 + BiLSTM on 430K+ images. Achieved >99% accuracy with TensorFlow.

### 9. **ECG Classifier with BPTT-LSTMs**
Trained a temporal LSTM model to classify ECG signals into Normal, AF, and Other rhythms. Used signal segmentation and temporal pattern augmentation. Reached ~90% accuracy.

### 10. **Energy Load Predictor**
Used XGBoost + feature engineering to predict smart building energy consumption. Tuning done via Weights & Biases.

### 11. **BCI for VR (Unity + C++)**
Created an EEG-based brain-computer interface for interactive control of Unity3D environments using consumer-grade headsets.
